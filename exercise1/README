EXERCISE 1
----------

In this exercise, you will just create a simple script in a file called "0_hello_world.sh". Shell scripts have the ".sh" extension by convention, but your scripts will work anyway if you use another one or even none at all.

This is what you can do:

1. Create a new file
touch 0_hello_world.sh

2. Open it for edition. Kate is a nice text editor, for instance:
kate 0_hello_world.sh &

Note the & will open Kate in a new window, but will let you use your shell at the same time. If you don't include the &, you will have to open a new shell or close Kate in order to interact with the command line.

3. Write the contents of the script. In this case we'll just print out a text message in the screen:
#!/bin/bash
# Print out a message in the shell
echo "Hello World!"

4. Save the script and try to execute it:
./0_hello_world.sh

You have surely got this message:
bash: ./0_hello_world.sh: Permission denied

This means you have no permissions to execute the script yet!

5. Check current file permissions
ls -l 0_hello_world.sh

Look at the beginning of the output of this command: 
-rw-rw-r-- 

The r's and w's mean that all users have read permissions, and some of the have write permissions. To give execution permissions, you could do this:
chmod a+x 0_hello_world.sh

Check the permissions again and you'll see this:
-rwxrwxr-x

Those x's mean everyone has execution permisions for this script.

6. Execute the script
./0_hello_world.sh

You should see a "Hello World!" message printed out in the shell.
