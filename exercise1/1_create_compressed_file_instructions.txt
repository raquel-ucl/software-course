EXERCISE 1
----------

In this exercise, you will create a compressed file containing a few sample images to send to another colleague. 
The sample images and documents are in the resources folder. 

1. Have a play with the zip and tar command, for example:
cd resources
zip -v   EO_images.zip *.jpg
tar -cfv EO_images.tar *.jpg
These will create a compressed file containing the images in the resources folder. Check them out by doing:
ls -lh
Notice the size in human readable format? One of the compressing methods has created a more compressed output. Which is it?

Know more about these commands by running:
man zip
man tar
Exit the help by pressing "q".

2. Start editing your script: 
cd..
kate 1_create_compressed_file.sh &

3. Content shoud be something like this to start with:
#!/bin/bash
# Print out a message in the shell
echo "Creating compressed file EO_images.zip ..."

4. Add the command to create this compressed file:
# Create compressed file
zip -v  EO_images.zip resources/*.jpg

Notice the images are not in the same folder as the script is, so you need to include the relative path to them for the script to find them.


One step further:
alias ll?
unzip, tar x?
